## Overview

The "Digi-Box" is an Arduino-based device that captures digital inputs
from a pin header and reports input state changes via USB. This is intended
to be used as a low-speed logic analyzer.

(**FIXME** - Integrate pattern generation and more flexible data-logging so
that this is more useful.)
